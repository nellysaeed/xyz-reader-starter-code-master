= XYZ Reader

XYZ Reader displays a list of articles that the user can read. As a part of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree, I redesigned the app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translated a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app. The app including support for older API versions and features animations and transitions for devices higher than Lollipop.

##Things I learned

Understanding the fundamentals of Android design.
Applying Material Design guidelines to a mobile application.
Separating an interface into surfaces.
Effectively using transitions and motion.
